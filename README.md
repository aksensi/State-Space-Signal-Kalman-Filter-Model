# Discrete-time-Time-invariant-Kalman-signal-model

## Repository Type: Academic Project

# Project Description
NCSU ECE 751 - Detection, Estimation and Filtering Theory - Software Project 1
- Instructor: Prof. G. Bottomley
  -  Implement the discrete-time, time-invariant Kalman signal model in a MATLAB function. The function should produce both a sequence of N length-𝑁𝑟 measurements and a 
sequence of N length-𝑁𝑥 state vectors. Your function should be general, allowing for arbitrary F, G and C matrices as well as state vector initial conditions. You may assume that both the plant noise and measurement noise vectors consist of uncorrelated random variables, though they may have different variances. Thus, the  corresponding covariance matrices are diagonal with possibly different diagonal elements.
  

  
## About
- kalman_run has the code file which has comments for reference. The inputs of the filter is taken by example 9.10 from the textbook, Detection, Estimation and Modulation Theory -  Van Trees.
- The document that starts with ECE751 has the output of the filter and is a detailed explaination of the project.
