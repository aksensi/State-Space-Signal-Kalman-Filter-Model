# State-Space-Signal-Kalman-Filter-model

## Repository Type: Academic Project

# Project Description
NCSU ECE 751 - Detection, Estimation and Filtering Theory - Software Project 1
- Instructor: Prof. G. Bottomley
  -  In MATLAB, a State Space Signal Model for a dynamic system having a straight-line trajectory with constant velocity to produce real values and measurements with noise input to the filter.
  - Obtain Kalman gain that decides the measure of importance that should be given to either the measurement state or preceded state.
  - Obtain Process Covariance matrix that represents the error in the estimate or process through a matrix of position or velocity. 
  - Compare the theoretical MSE and Instantaneous MSE where theoretical is the diagonal matrix of the Process Covariance matrix, position and velocity respectively.

  

  
## About
- kalman_run has the code file which has comments for reference. The inputs of the filter is taken by example 9.10 from the textbook, Detection, Estimation and Modulation Theory -  Van Trees.
- The document that starts with ECE751 has the output of the filter and is a detailed explaination of the project.
